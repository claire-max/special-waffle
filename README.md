## Description
    Built a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about 
    employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage 
    that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, 
    so youâ€™ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.

  ## Usage
  This command-line application dynamically generates a team.html from a user's input. The application will be invoked with the following command: ```md node index.js``` You will be taken through a series of prompts. Answer them in as much detail as possible. Then a sample.html file is generated. 

  ## Tests
  Make sure that all tests are passed to help build classes. Used Jest for each class Employee, Engineer, Intern, and Manager. Use command ```npm test```
