## Description
    Built a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about 
    employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage 
    that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, 
    so you’ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.
